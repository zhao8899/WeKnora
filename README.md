# 💡 WeKnora - LLM-Powered Document Understanding & Retrieval Framework

## 📌 Overview

[**WeKnora**](https://weknora.weixin.qq.com) is an LLM-powered intelligent knowledge management and Q&A framework built for enterprise-grade document understanding and semantic retrieval.

WeKnora offers two Q&A modes — **Quick Q&A** and **Intelligent Reasoning**. Quick Q&A uses a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline to rapidly retrieve relevant chunks and generate answers, ideal for everyday knowledge queries. Intelligent Reasoning is powered by a **ReACT Agent** engine that employs a **progressive strategy** to autonomously orchestrate knowledge retrieval, MCP tools, and web search, iteratively reasoning and reflecting to arrive at a final conclusion — suited for multi-source synthesis and complex tasks. Custom agents are also supported, allowing flexible configuration of dedicated knowledge bases, tool sets, and system prompts. Choose the right mode for the task, balancing response speed with reasoning depth.

The framework supports auto-syncing knowledge from Feishu (more data sources coming soon), handles 10+ document formats including PDF, Word, images, and Excel, and can serve Q&A directly through IM channels like WeCom, Feishu, Slack, and Telegram. It is compatible with major LLM providers including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Alibaba Cloud), Zhipu, Hunyuan, Gemini, MiniMax, NVIDIA, and Ollama. Its fully modular design allows swapping LLMs, vector databases, and storage backends, with support for local and private cloud deployment ensuring complete data sovereignty.

## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don't need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Start infrastructure
make dev-start

# Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-app

# Start frontend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging

**Detailed Documentation:** [Development Environment Quick Start](./docs/开发指南.md)

### 🧪 QA Mode Smoke Test

After starting the backend and ensuring you have a valid tenant API key plus a knowledge base ID, you can quickly verify the three core QA paths:

```bash
make qa-mode-smoke API_KEY=sk-... KB_ID=<knowledge-base-id> BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1
```

This smoke check exercises:

- `chat`
- `rag_fast`
- `rag_deep`

It is intended as a lightweight regression check for mode routing and SSE response basics.

For a GitHub-hosted/manual verification path, you can also trigger the `QA Mode Smoke` workflow after configuring these repository secrets:

- `WEKNORA_SMOKE_API_KEY`
- `WEKNORA_SMOKE_KB_ID`
